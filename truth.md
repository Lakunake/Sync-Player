## Truth

I've started this project with AI because i did not know how to code and didnt have time to learn because of... personal reasons. But throughout this process i've learned the used languages to some point that i am now making the 60% of new updates. I currently use AI to generate me a template-ish type of thing for me to edit. However that does not justify the use of AI. my final goal is to strip myself of this need as soon as possible. I do not condone the use of it. AI code is not something to be proud of. If a person with almost no coding knowledge other than smallbasic and no time to learn actual coding can learn with just examining and asking, you can do too, eventually. AI is wasting our waters and we humans don't depend on AI to survive.

PS: I'm not running something like a 9 agent workflow BS to code this, im really using the bare bones of it from the start.
